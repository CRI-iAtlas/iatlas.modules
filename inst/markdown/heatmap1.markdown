Here, you can look at correlation of a response variable, with other variables, within each group.
Select the response variable, and a variable class on the left to specify which other variables you would like to correlate the response variable with.
The result will be a heatmap.

Click on any cell in the heatmap to see the underlying data as a scatterplot. In the scatterplot, each point represents a sample, the response variable is shown on the Y-axis and the row variable is shown on the X-axis.
